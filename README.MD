# Computer Science - bachelors' studies

In this repository I've collected most of my work from my college.
I've started attending in October 2023, Expecting graduation in June/July 2026.

## What is the most important what I've learnt?

### Team-work

Sounds boring, but together with peers we've worked together which grew my communicating skills. I am not talking about cheating but creeating tests for assigments which were assigned to us. We've managed to learn together for long hours, which i am totally grateful for

### Computer Architecture

In my 2nd semester I've attended Computer Architecture course that stuck in my mind and i've loved it.

### distributed programming

It was just an glipse of distributed programming and I would love it to be able to learn more (and I am looking forward to it).
You can see my projects here:

I've learn the theorical problems in multithreading, sycnhrponous and asynchronous communication between hosts. More here:
