# Computer Science - Bachelor's Studies

In this repository, I've collected most of my work from college.
I started attending in October 2023 and expect to graduate in June/July 2026.

## What Have I Learned That's Most Important?

### Teamwork

This might sound boring, but working together with peers has significantly improved my communication skills. I'm not talking about cheating, but rather creating tests for assignments that were given to us. We've managed to study together for long hours, which I am totally grateful for.

### Computer Architecture

In my 2nd semester, I attended a Computer Architecture course that really stuck with me and I absolutely loved it.

### Concurrent programming

It was just a glimpse of concurrent programming, and I would love to learn more about it (looking forward to diving deeper).
You can see my projects here:

I've learned about theoretical problems in multithreading, synchronous and asynchronous communication between hosts. More here:
